      dynamicStableScale:
        description: |-
          DynamicStableScale is a traffic routing feature which dynamically scales the stable
          ReplicaSet to minimize total pods which are running during an update. This is calculated by
          scaling down the stable as traffic is increased to canary. When disabled (the default behavior)
          the stable ReplicaSet remains fully scaled to support instantaneous aborts.
        type: boolean
      maxSurge:
        $ref: '#/definitions/intstr.IntOrString'
        description: |-
          MaxSurge The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of
          pods.
          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total pods at
          the start of the update (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
          By default, a value of 25% is used.
          Example: when this is set to 30%, the new RC can be scaled up by 30%
          immediately when the rolling update starts. Once old pods have been killed,
          new RC can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running
          at any time during the update is at most 130% of original pods.
          +optional
        type: object
      maxUnavailable:

          MaxUnavailable The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total pods at the start of update (ex: 10%).
          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
          This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
          By default, a fixed value of 25% is used.
          Example: when this is set to 30%, the old RC can be scaled down by 30%
          immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old RC
          can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new RC, ensuring
          that at least 70% of original number of pods are available at all times
          during the update.

      scaleDownDelaySeconds:
        description: |-
          ScaleDownDelaySeconds adds a delay before scaling down the previous ReplicaSet when the
          canary strategy is used with traffic routing (default 30 seconds). A delay in scaling down
          the previous ReplicaSet is needed after switching the stable service selector to point to
          the new ReplicaSet, in order to give time for traffic providers to re-target the new pods.
          This value is ignored with basic, replica-weighted canary without traffic routing.

          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

          `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have
          been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is
          homologous to each other.

          `Indexed` means that the Pods of a
          Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1),
          available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index.
          The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
          for each index.
          When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and
          `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5.

          This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the
          IndexedJob feature gate. More completion modes can be added in the future.
          If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, the
          controller skips updates for the Job.

          pod signals the success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive
          value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that
          pod signals the success of the job.

          and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true,
          the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying
          the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this
          and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see

          controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from
          false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated
          with this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this.
          Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively
          resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. This is an alpha field and
          requires the SuspendJob feature gate to be enabled; otherwise this field

      deletionTimestamp:

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          the record has been checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted,

          to load or validate the Assigned config, etc.
          Errors may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or
          checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across
          Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in
          a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error
          by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource.
          You can find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log.
          Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error
          is empty, but should not rely on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.

          The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines
          that the Assigned config is stable and correct.
          This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local
          record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end
          of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is
          reset to nil (use local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil,
          because the local default config is always assumed good.
          You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability
          and correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,

          housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or
          understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a
          controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
          "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the
          workflow used when modifying the object.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          There are five possible phase values:

          Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
          container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
          well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
          Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
          At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
          Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
          Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
          terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
          by the system.
          Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
          error in communicating with the host of the pod.

      deletionTimestamp:

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          topologyKeys is a preference-order list of topology keys which
          implementations of services should use to preferentially sort endpoints
          when accessing this Service, it can not be used at the same time as
          externalTrafficPolicy=Local.
          Topology keys must be valid label keys and at most 16 keys may be specified.
          Endpoints are chosen based on the first topology key with available backends.
          If this field is specified and all entries have no backends that match
          the topology of the client, the service has no backends for that client
          and connections should fail.
          The special value "*" may be used to mean "any topology". This catch-all
          value, if used, only makes sense as the last value in the list.
          If this is not specified or empty, no topology constraints will be applied.
          This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the ServiceTopology feature.

          type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
          options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
          specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
          than a virtual IP.
          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
          as the clusterIP.
          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

      maxSkew:
        description: |-
          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 1/1/0:
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          |   P   |   P   |       |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1;
          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2)
          violate MaxSkew(1).
          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
          to topologies that satisfy it.
          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
        type: integer
      topologyKey:
        description: |-
          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
          of pods into each bucket.
          It's a required field.
        type: string
      whenUnsatisfiable:
        description: |-
          WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
          the spread constraint.
          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
            skew.
          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
          if and only if every possible node assigment for that pod would violate
          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
          won't make it *more* imbalanced.
          It's a required field.

        description: |-
          Ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
          and deleted when the pod is removed.

          Use this if:
          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
             tracking are needed,
          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
             information on the connection between this volume type
             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
          of an individual pod.

          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
          more information.

          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
          persistent volumes at the same time.

          This is a beta feature and only available when the GenericEphemeralVolume
          feature gate is enabled.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry

          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique
          name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
          The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
          unique on the server.

          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
          ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

          Applied only if Name is not specified.

          The resolution of a destination rule to apply to a service occurs in the

          it to be included in the resolution hierarchy for services in
          other namespaces. This feature provides a mechanism for service owners
          and mesh administrators to control the visibility of destination rules
          across namespace boundaries.

          If no namespaces are specified then the destination rule is exported to all
          namespaces by default.

          The value "." is reserved and defines an export to the same namespace that
          the destination rule is declared in. Similarly, the value "*" is reserved and
          defines an export to all namespaces.

          By default workloads are searched across all namespaces based on label selectors.
          This implies that a gateway resource in the namespace "foo" can select pods in
          the namespace "bar" based on labels.
          This behavior can be controlled via the `PILOT_SCOPE_GATEWAY_TO_NAMESPACE`
          environment variable in istiod. If this variable is set
          to true, the scope of label search is restricted to the configuration
          namespace in which the the resource is present. In other words, the Gateway
          resource must reside in the same namespace as the gateway workload
          instance.

          One or more hosts exposed by this gateway.
          While typically applicable to
          HTTP services, it can also be used for TCP services using TLS with SNI.
          A host is specified as a `dnsName` with an optional `namespace/` prefix.
          The `dnsName` should be specified using FQDN format, optionally including
          a wildcard character in the left-most component (e.g., `prod/*.example.com`).
          Set the `dnsName` to `*` to select all `VirtualService` hosts from the
          specified namespace (e.g.,`prod/*`).

          The `namespace` can be set to `*` or `.`, representing any or the current
          namespace, respectively. For example, `*/foo.example.com` selects the
          service from any available namespace while `./foo.example.com` only selects
          the service from the namespace of the sidecar. The default, if no `namespace/`
          is specified, is `*/`, that is, select services from any namespace.
          Any associated `DestinationRule` in the selected namespace will also be used.

          A `VirtualService` must be bound to the gateway and must have one or
          more hosts that match the hosts specified in a server. The match
          could be an exact match or a suffix match with the server's hosts. For
          example, if the server's hosts specifies `*.example.com`, a
          `VirtualService` with hosts `dev.example.com` or `prod.example.com` will
          match. However, a `VirtualService` with host `example.com` or
          `newexample.com` will not match.

          NOTE: Only virtual services exported to the gateway's namespace
          (e.g., `exportTo` value of `*`) can be referenced.
          Private configurations (e.g., `exportTo` set to `.`) will not be
          available. Refer to the `exportTo` setting in `VirtualService`,
          `DestinationRule`, and `ServiceEntry` configurations for details.

          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and

          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.

          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,

        description: |-
          A list of namespaces to which this virtual service is exported. Exporting a
          virtual service allows it to be used by sidecars and gateways defined in
          other namespaces. This feature provides a mechanism for service owners
          and mesh administrators to control the visibility of virtual services
          across namespace boundaries.

          If no namespaces are specified then the virtual service is exported to all
          namespaces by default.

          The value "." is reserved and defines an export to the same namespace that
          the virtual service is declared in. Similarly the value "*" is reserved and
          defines an export to all namespaces.

      gateways:
        description: |-
          The names of gateways and sidecars that should apply these routes.
          Gateways in other namespaces may be referred to by
          `<gateway namespace>/<gateway name>`; specifying a gateway with no
          namespace qualifier is the same as specifying the VirtualService's
          namespace. A single VirtualService is used for sidecars inside the mesh as
          well as for one or more gateways. The selection condition imposed by this
          field can be overridden using the source field in the match conditions
          of protocol-specific routes. The reserved word `mesh` is used to imply
          all the sidecars in the mesh. When this field is omitted, the default
          gateway (`mesh`) will be used, which would apply the rule to all
          sidecars in the mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the
          rules will apply only to the gateways. To apply the rules to both
          gateways and sidecars, specify `mesh` as one of the gateway names.

      hosts:
        description: |-
          The destination hosts to which traffic is being sent. Could
          be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or an IP address.  Depending on the
          platform, short-names can also be used instead of a FQDN (i.e. has no
          dots in the name). In such a scenario, the FQDN of the host would be
          derived based on the underlying platform.

          A single VirtualService can be used to describe all the traffic
          properties of the corresponding hosts, including those for multiple
          HTTP and TCP ports. Alternatively, the traffic properties of a host
          can be defined using more than one VirtualService, with certain
          caveats. Refer to the
          [Operations Guide](https://istio.io/docs/ops/best-practices/traffic-management/#split-virtual-services)
          for details.

          *Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. "reviews"
          instead of "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local"), Istio will interpret
          the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A
          rule in the "default" namespace containing a host "reviews" will be
          interpreted as "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", irrespective of
          the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid
          potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully
          qualified domain names over short names._

          The hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP services. Service inside
          the mesh, i.e., those found in the service registry, must always be
          referred to using their alphanumeric names. IP addresses are allowed
          only for services defined via the Gateway.

          *Note*: It must be empty for a delegate VirtualService.
